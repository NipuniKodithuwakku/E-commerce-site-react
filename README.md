## deploy with Netlify
We will start by creating a build of our application by running this command:

<b>npm run build</b>

So, now our build folder will get generated which will contain all the production-ready files.
<br>
<h2>Drag & Drop</h2>
Netifly has made it so easy that we have to just drag and drop our build folder into their online app (Rightmost image above), <br>
and our application will get deployed to a live URL.

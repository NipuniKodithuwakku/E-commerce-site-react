## deploy with Netlify
We will start by creating a build of our application by running this command:

<b>npm run build</b>

So, now our build folder will get generated which will contain all the production-ready files.
##Drag & Drop
Netifly has made it so easy that we have to just drag and drop our build folder into their online app (Rightmost image above), 
and our application will get deployed to a live URL.
